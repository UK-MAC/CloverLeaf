!>  @brief Driver for the field summary kernels
!>  @author Wayne Gaudin
!>  @details The user specified field summary kernel is invoked here. A summation
!>  across all mesh chunks is then performed and the information outputed.
!>  If the run is a test problem, the final result is compared with the expected
!>  result and the difference output.
!>  Note the reference solution is the value returned from an Intel compiler with
!>  ieee options set on a single core crun.
